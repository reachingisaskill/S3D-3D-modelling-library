# Todo List

- Make colour class validate the setters all values [0,1]

- Make a "Texture" base class (I think?) handles the BDRF distributions?

- Add lighting base and derived classes

- Add manager lighting and camera handlers

- Finalise the architecture for the rendering heavy lifting (ray-tracer class?)
