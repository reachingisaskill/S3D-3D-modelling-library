# Todo List

- Make colour class validate the setters all values [0,1]

- Make a "Texture" base class (I think?) handles the BDRF distributions?

- Add lighting base and derived classes

- Add manager lighting and camera handlers

- Finalise the architecture for the rendering heavy lifting (ray-tracer class?)

- Frame class include some connection to monitor primaries to reweight the colours to be more consistent between monitors?
  I'm not sure my eyes are good enough to tell the difference...

- Interaction model?! Need the position, surface normal, surface paramters to determine colour/texture details all in a single object.
